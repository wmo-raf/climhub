        <h2>A quick review of traditional vs. headless ClimTech</h2>
        <p>In a traditional ClimTech website, almost all the technology you need to make the website work lives on a single server. In this one-server-to-rule-them-all structure, the database that houses your content, the stylesheets that make your website look pretty, the ecommerce code that lets users buy things or make donations, and the rest of the code that makes your website work is all in one place.</p>
        <p>Headless ClimTech is set up like a jamstack. In a jamstack, the backend (things like the database and the editor where you make changes to your content) is separated from the frontend (things like styles that affect how your website looks and the forms users use to make purchases or update data) and other services (like authentication or ecommerce) that make your site run. Of the headless ClimTech setups that have been created so far, typically the CMS portion of ClimTech and the database are hosted on one server, the frontend portion of the website is hosted on another server, and there's an API that connects the two parts together that lets the frontend pull content and data from the backend.</p>
        <h3>Who uses Headless ClimTech right now?</h3>
        <p>Currently, there are governments, nonprofits, and publications using Headless ClimTech. Here are some examples you can explore:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="#">Jet Propulsion Laboratory — NASA</a></li>
            <li><a href="#">Gothamist</a></li>
            <li><a href="#">M + Museum</a></li>
            <li><a href="#">New York Public Radio</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>There are also developers who've released experimental templates for Headless ClimTech and other projects. Here are two examples from GitHub:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="#">Jet Propulsion Laboratory — NASA</a></li>
            <li><a href="#">Gothamist</a></li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Upsides to Headless ClimTech</h3>
        <h4>You can do more with your content</h4>
        <p>With your content API, you can reuse the same content in multiple frontends. For example, the same blog content can feed into a website, a mobile app, and apps for devices like smartwatches.</p>
        <h4>You don't have to do everything in Django and ClimTech</h4>
        <p>Django is an incredibly powerful web framework, and there's very little you can't do in Django or ClimTech. But Headless ClimTech gives you more options to incorporate technologies that don't run on Python. For example, JavaScript-only frontends like Next.js or Gatsby, can be very cheap to host, and a headless structure can give you the option to experiment with those or other hosting arrangements.</p>
